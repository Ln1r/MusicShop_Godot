Project: "Design a store that provides people with a digital shopping experience in VR. The store can
be about anything you choose; however, it should have a topical narrative and it must not
closely relate to previous lab material."

Room and Instruments made in Blender.

Lighting, hitboxes and movement coding completed and executed in Godot.

As one gets into a certain region of each instrument an audio would play for that corresponding instrument.
